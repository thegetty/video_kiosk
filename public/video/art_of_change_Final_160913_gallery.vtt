00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.010 align:middle line:84%
LENA: When I need to figure
something out in my head

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.150 align:middle line:90%
I draw.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.890 align:middle line:84%
WYNTON: I draw constantly,
everywhere I go.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.430 align:middle line:84%
SANDY: For me every drawing
is a process of discovery.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.880 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of drawing is
that you can see the process.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.521 align:middle line:84%
And see the artists working and
thinking through a composition.

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:22.110 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.052 align:middle line:84%
When you look at old master
drawings by an artist like

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:84%
da Vinci or GÃ©ricault, you
can still see them trying

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:84%
to capture the right
line, the right movement,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
there on the page even
hundreds of years later.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:84%
When artists draw, they often
correct their first lines,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and these changes can usually
be seen in the final drawing.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Art historians even have a
word for these corrections

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.860 align:middle line:90%
and changes, "pentimenti."

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:84%
In Italian, the word can
connote regret or remorse.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:84%
But a broader meaning
is a reconsideration,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:84%
a second thought or
a changing of mind.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:84%
The artist might be
exploring composition

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.526 align:middle line:90%
or emotion or expression.

00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:12.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.960 align:middle line:84%
There is this wonderful drawing
by the Italian artist Pontormo,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:84%
where you can still
see the first figure he

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.110 align:middle line:84%
drew on the piece of
paper, a standing woman.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Then he decided to draw
another subject altogether,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%
but the first figure
is still there creating

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
volume and support
for the dying Christ.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:84%
LENA: I love that
in many drawings,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.159 align:middle line:84%
you can see the artist
change his or her mind.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you go up
to a piece of art

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and you're like how was this
made, how did this even happen?

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:84%
But with drawing, if
you can see the lines,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:84%
you can see that they had to
work for it and change a lot.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And they have a process and
it's not just like magic,

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.400 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't come out
right away. [LAUGHS]

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I love drawing
faces because it's

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:84%
like something you
look at every day,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:84%
so it's something you're
very familiar with.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
This line didn't
really work out,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and so I'm just going to go
over it with a darker color

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:84%
so I can distinguish it from
the first round of lines.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.520 align:middle line:84%
SANDY: When the drawing
is just not working out,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:84%
you can keep tweaking it and
pushing it, or just drawing

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.910 align:middle line:90%
over it until it feels right.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes you just can't
make big enough changes

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.440 align:middle line:84%
by drawing over, like when
Rembrandt cut and pasted

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:84%
a jagged slice of paper on
top of his overworked drawing

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle line:90%
so he could start from scratch.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.410 align:middle line:84%
WYNTON: When drawing on the
computer I can cut and paste.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I can ink and transform and
move parts of the drawing.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And it is much more efficient
than doing it by hand.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.060 align:middle line:84%
SANDY: I might try to
hide or cover up a change,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.030 align:middle line:90%
but I might not.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I like
leaving them in.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Keeping these changes,
these pentimenti,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:84%
gives a liveliness and dynamism
that's unique to drawing.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
WYNTON: Sometimes
unplanned marks

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:84%
make the drawing look better or
create a new line that actually

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:84%
improves it, something you
can work with and draw over

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.770 align:middle line:84%
to create the drawing
closer to what you planned.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.530 align:middle line:84%
LENA: When you see
lines underneath,

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.750 align:middle line:84%
it makes me feel more
comfortable as an artist

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:84%
knowing that I can
get there, too.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And you understand
it a little bit more.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.290 align:middle line:84%
It makes you more in awe of
what they've done because you

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.460 align:middle line:90%
know the steps they took.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:90%
