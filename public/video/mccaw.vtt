00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.330
I've just always
loved the darkroom.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.030
I've loved the process
of getting your hands wet

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.510
and that magic of
photography as the image

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.370
forms in the developer
and that reaction

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.340
to chemistry and light.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.890
So today, we're going
to South San Francisco,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.090
right on the edge of
San Francisco Bay.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.070
And we will be burning
holes in photo paper

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.630
using the lens of my camera,
documenting the arc of the sun

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.505
as it slowly rises.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.630
The basic concept is I'm
using the lens of the camera

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.960
much like you'd use a
magnifying glass to burn a leaf.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.090
I'm taking that principle
and using a camera to do it.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.710
The lens is the magnifying glass
and instead of the dry leaf,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.870
I have a piece of photographic
black and white paper

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.790
inside the camera where
the film usually would go.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.337
And then I just do these
long exposures of the sun,

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.335
and I burn pieces of paper.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.410
The optics that I use
are--a lot of them

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.968
are these military lenses,
some of which are radioactive!

00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:30.290
[laughs] And what
they do is they're

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.690
exponentially brighter than
traditional lenses for a view

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.510
camera.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.595
So they just make the sun
that much more intense.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.760
Only certain kinds of paper
will solarize in a way

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.430
where you can really
see the landscape.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.850
So most of my
sun-based work is made

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.910
on vintage, old, black and
white photographic paper.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.220
And I'm opening these
old boxes, and it's

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.320
like I'm connecting,
in some way,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.130
with the history of
photography on a certain level.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.875
A lot of times, I'm in the same
spot from sunrise to sunset.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.030
Today's exposure will only
take about a couple hours.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.930
And also, we're close to the
equinox so the arc of the sun

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.870
is really going to be almost
a 45-degree angle that's

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.370
straight.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.911
There's not much
curvature happening.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.490
Because I'm dealing
with silhouettes--

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.230
I'm photographing into the sun,
so whatever's in front of me

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.180
is going to be backlit.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.160
Have to use a horizon
to explain where I am.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.190
Each piece actually kind of has
a time signature built into it.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.350
You could, if you
figured out where I was,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.620
and you saw the position
of the sun in relationship

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.560
to a mountain horizon, you would
know roughly what time of year

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.850
that image was made.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.810
By working on this
project, it's kind of

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.100
made me reconsider your
existence in the world.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.070
You watch space being
utilized and experienced

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.310
for really just small,
short moments of time.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.414
And in the meantime, the sun is
just always rising and setting

00:03:17.414 --> 00:03:18.830
and people are
living their lives.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.380
There's something
about that element

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.810
of time in our existence and
how we experience the planet.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.440
It's fun to be kind of
in a space in photography

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.350
where nobody's
been there before.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.990
Analog photography isn't dead.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.120
There's places to
go we haven't been.
