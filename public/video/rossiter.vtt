[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.290
My name is Alison Rossiter,
and I'm a photographer.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.720
I learned photography
in the 20th century

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.020
by working in a darkroom
with film and paper.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.710
The abstract nature of
my work has come to me

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.590
by finding these discoveries
in expired photographic paper.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.710
These are images that
are making themselves.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.520
They're there by chance.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.080
These are latent images that
are made by atmospheric damage

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.130
or light leaks, someone
opening the package, mold,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.620
all sorts of things.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.310
I have collected papers
from every decade

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.380
of the 20th century.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.030
It's a bit of a time
traveling experience for me

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.890
to work with a
paper that suggests

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.635
the date that the Titanic
went down, or the Depression.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.920
When I'm using a paper
that expired in 1912,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:20.010
and I pick that paper up in
2012, I've got a century.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.680
In the 20th century,
almost everything

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.610
had an expiration
date stamped on it.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.540
And the dates on
the paper packages

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.950
suggest a timeline
through history.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.600
These papers were amazing.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.140
And so what you're seeing
are the beautiful cream

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.000
colored highlights, the warm
blacks, the cold blacks.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.660
There are different avenues
in the work with the expired

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.010
paper.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.520
The first was just finding the
found photograms, the paper

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.510
that had a latent image on
it for one reason or another,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.990
and I just send it
through the chemistry.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.760
And then I found that a lot of
paper, particularly from 1930

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.940
and earlier, will just go
black in the developer.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.230
That's all it's going
to be able to do.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.940
So with that paper,
I set that aside,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.060
and that's for work where
I selectively develop it.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.820
And I will pour
chemistry down the page.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.340
I will dip chemistry
to form a sharp line.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.210
Or I will allow a pool of the
chemistry to float and find

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.470
its own shape on the page.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.875
And those are all
darkroom techniques.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.460
I remind myself every
time I'm in the darkroom

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.210
that I am dealing with silver.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.470
The silver tarnishes, just
the way a fork and a spoon

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.480
would tarnish.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.490
And these prints are instantly
old when I develop them.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.940
I mean, it would take years
for that to develop naturally.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.880
And they honor an age.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.980
These prints do point to
the history of photography.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.750
Do point to a time period
that is so far behind us,

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.050
but we're getting to see it.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.950
When I think of my
lake landscapes,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.010
I actually think
of Edward Steichen

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.740
and some of the absolutely
beautiful gum prints

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.790
that he made.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.590
They're soft and evocative.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.780
The harder-edged image is not
unlike Edward Weston's sand

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.500
dunes, photographed in the '30s.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.550
Some of the most
exciting discoveries

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.360
have been simple things, such
as finding the fingerprints

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.600
of the previous photographer.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.400
It is this absolutely
wonderful sensation

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.650
to touch something
that someone else did

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.260
over this great span of time.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.700
My work began as a lament.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.310
I was sad that these
things were gone.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.310
Sad to find out that so many
beautiful materials existed

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.160
long before I was
a photographer,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.180
and so those are gone to me.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.910
And then the
sadness disappeared,

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.890
and I realized that I am using
these with a new purpose.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.630
I'm bringing them back
into a contemporary venue.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.820
And the beauty of all
these manufactured papers

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.580
are allowed to be
admired by a new audience

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.790
in a different
context completely.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.840
