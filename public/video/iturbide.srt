00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,410
Meet Graciela Iturbide. She is one of

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,379
the most famous photographers from

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,240
Mexico. She captures cultures across

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,719
Mexico and the world along with their

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,670
everyday lives and rituals. Most of her

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,850
work is in black and white, vivid and

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,980
beautiful. These experiences become part

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,490
of her story and she becomes 

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,900
part of theirs.

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,760
What cultures are part of your story? 

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,429
One of her most famous photographs 

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,800
is called Mujer ángel or Angel Woman. She looks like

13
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,750
she's about to take flight. The woman

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,590
lives traditionally in Mexico's remote

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,770
Sonora Desert,

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,480
yet she carries a boombox: evidence of

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,750
modern or more industrial culture

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,730
creeping in. Another famous photograph

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,489
shows a woman advertising her wares in

20
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,190
the local market,  in this case iguanas on

21
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,350
her head! Itubide eventually chose the

22
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,410
shot where the woman is strong and

23
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,180
determined. When you look at the contact

24
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,910
sheet, though, you'll see it took lots of

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,039
tries to get there. In some photos she

26
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,989
looks uncomfortable, like the iguanas are

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,299
going to spill off her head. But she's

28
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,750
also laughing, clearly enjoying her photo

29
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,430
shoot. In the 1980s Iturbide

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,610
photographed the “White Fence” area of

31
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,650
East LA.  Again, people seem to live in

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,259
between identities, both American and

33
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,680
Mexican. Another theme in Iturbide’s

34
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,780
work is birds. They can stand for ideas

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,540
about flight or escape because they're

36
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,850
not tethered to the earth. They can also

37
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,030
stand for a unique view-what Iturbide

38
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,830
refers to as “eyes that fly.” What do

39
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,820
the birds in your neighborhood see?

40
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,890
And then there are the cactus plants. 

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,590
Iturbide finds beauty and stature in

42
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,930
the variety of cactus textures. Her

43
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,790
photography captures this and also plays

44
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,240
with the idea of the cactus as the most

45
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,680
representative plant of Mexico. When you

46
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,160
walk in your neighborhood, 

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,380
what do you see?

48
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,750
Iturbide would want you to capture

49
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,170
your culture. She's waiting to see what

50
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,170
you come up with.
